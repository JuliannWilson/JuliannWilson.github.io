Sora from Kingdom Hearts being recent ones added to the rooster along with a new score of music to specific well known stages from these characters games.</p>

      <h1>River City Girls 2 : Round 2 and Back in School</h1>

       “I cannot believe! There’s a sequel to the popular modern beat ’em up title River City Girls!” <br>
	   Well you better believe there back and better than ever before. 
	   It seems like yesterday they were saving their supposed boyfriends and now their saving the town from the Yazuka’s original head. 
	   The game was developed and published by Wayford Games along with two other publishers Limited Run Games and Arc System Works. 
	   It was released in 2022 and it’s popularity and fanbase are still going strong.
      </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  The sequel master piece tops the it’s predecessor in several ways from UI, more unlockable move set and combos, more intense action, better animation along with a combination of manga comic inspired aesthetic, new music along with a collaboration, World Building and more playable characters.
	  </p>
	  <article id="image" class="item">

    </article>
	<br>
	  <h>The Characters</h><p>Unlike it’s predecessor River City Girls 2 adds 4 new playable characters to the roster of characters to select. 
	  The main protagonist, Two new characters and the two crushes of the girls Kunio and Riki totaling to 6 playable characters in total. 
	  This adds more variety to gameplay and selection of characters. 
	  Not only that instead of the main two characters being involved through the story and interact with non playable characters the other 4 characters can interact through the story through dialogue. 
	  An major pro is that you can switch character’s anytime without restarting your save. 
	  You can just use a save house which will not only be a play for your characters to relax an not worry about any enemies appearing but a place for you to switch characters.</p>
	  <br>
	  
	  <h>The Story</h><p>One of the things that stayed the same as the last game is it’s simple story structure. 
	  After taking out the original Yakuza boss’ daughter he decided to get revenge on the two school girls who brought shame to his family by sending out his goons and family members on a rampage in the town and bring out two girls first by kicking them out of their school and taking over the city. 
	  After a few months they decided it’s time take back their home from the Yakuza once again.</p>

<h>The Gameplay</h><p>The Gameplay has upgraded from the last games basic move set to more complex attacks, combos and special attacks. 
Each six player have their own set of moves that are a combination of close range and long range every characters has their attack, 
combos and specials unique to them.
Having the choice to switch around each character so you can try out new move sets helps the player to determine their play style.</p>

	<br>
<h>The Cons of River City Girls 2</h><p>One of the main issue of the sequel is the constant back tracking you have to do from going to an objective only to run back to quest giver to complete your quests. 
The constant up and down can get very tiring and annoying. 
Though there are bus stops that can help you travel to certain points it wont take you to said location instead it can take you farther or to another district. 
There are only few bus stops in certain areas your going to have to run all the way back to the quest.<br>

Another major issue is that you cannot instantly rematch with the boss especially at a certain point. 
If you lose you have to start back from where you save. 
So if you go through the game without saving you’ll have to start from the very beginning.</p>
<br>
<h>Conclusion</h><p>Despite it’s slight major flaws River City is a game I would recommend and give a solid 8.5/10.
It's upgraded colorful visuals, new playable characters, game mechanics. 
Whenever your playing with your family or with your friends River City Girls 2 is the game for you.</p>
